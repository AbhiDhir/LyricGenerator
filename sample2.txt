down like pieces into place
and i can picture it after all these days
and i know it's long gone, and that magic's not here no more
and i might be okay, but i'm not fine at all
'cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
wind in my hair

the water's high
you're jumping into it
and letting go
and no one knows
that you cry
but you don't tell anyone
that you might
not be the golden one
and you're tied together with a smile
but you're coming undone
i guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
hoping it will end up in his pocket
but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
not his price to pay
hold on
baby you're losing it
